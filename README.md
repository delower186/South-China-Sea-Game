# South-China-Sea-Game
South china sea game development carried out based on conflicts in South China Sea. This is a simple game about south china sea dispute. China get attacked with sophisticated modern guided missiles or rockets but Chinese people have to defend themselves. The game is not so heavy or big as the South China Sea problem! But I can assure you that it won't be that easy either!
